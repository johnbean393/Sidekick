# Web Search

Web search allows Sidekick to respond with up to date information, and reduces the chance of hallucinations, where the chatbot responds with false information.

## Configure Web Search

To configure web search, navigate to `Sidekick` -> `Settings` -> `Retrieval` -> `Tavily Search`.

Click the toggle to enable or disable web search, and set an API key in the field below. Your API key will be encrypted with a key securely stored in your keychain.

You can create an API key by clicking the `Get an API Key` button, which will take you to [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/home).

You will need to sign up for an account and then create a new API key. Copy this key and paste it into the API key field in Sidekick's `Tavily Search` Settings.

Note that when web search is enabled, your prompt may be exposed to third parties such as Tavily.

## Using Web Search

Using web search is simple. Use click the `Web Search` button in the prompt bar to toggle web search.
